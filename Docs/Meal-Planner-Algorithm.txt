Liver Rotation: Beef Liver (100 grams); Chicken Liver (100 grams).

Seafood Rotation: Mackerel (100 grams); Oyster (75 grams); Herring (100 grams); Sardine (80 grams).

Meat Rotation: Pork (120 grams); Turkey (120 grams); Beef (120 grams); Chicken (120 grams).

Primary Protein Rotation: starting with the very first day and every 6th day (after a gap of 5 days),
pick the next item from Liver Rotation;
on other days alternate Seafood and Meat by picking the next item from their respective rotations.

Both Big and Medium Meals can include a grain, but not all of those meals include one.
Use the Stride Scheduling algorithm to pick a grain for a meal, but consider only those grains
that meet the Min Gap requirement (explained below).
Big Meal Grain Rotation includes the following grains and their priorities:
   Buckwheat: 42.4
   Millet: 23.6
   Barley: 14.5
   Wheat: 9.5
   Oat: 5.0
   White Rice: 5.0
Medium Meal Grain Rotation includes the following grains and their priorities:
   Oat: 1.0
   Millet: 1.0
   White Rice: 1.0

Every potential grain-carrying meal (Big and Medium) is considered a "Slot",
regardless of whether a grain is included in the meal.
Min Number of Slots (a.k.a. Gap) between picks of the same grain is configured for each grain.
In case a grain min gap is G, if the grain was picked in slot S, it's allowed to be picked again no earlier than in slot S + G + 1.
If no grain exists that meets the Min Gap requirement: declare a failure (throw an error).
In that case, the user will have to tweak parameters.
It's important to choose a Min Gap that does not result in the given grain being picked less often than its priority mandates.
Min Gaps:
   Buckwheat: 3
   Millet: 3
   Barley: 4
   Wheat: 5
   Oat: 4
   White Rice: 4
